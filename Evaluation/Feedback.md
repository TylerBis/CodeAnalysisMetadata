## Files & Changed Files
* Only required files committed
* Proper files changed

## Build
* Successfully builds, no errors, no warnings

## Test
* Passes all student's tests
* No extraneous output

## Test Oracle: code\_analysis\_t.cpp
* Fails a few tests in the oracle test suite with student's implementation

## Test Oracle: code\_analysis.cpp
* Fails an early test in the student's test suite with oracle implementation

## Code
* Inconsistent indentation. First 4 spaces, then 2 spaces
* return indented incorrectly in ```code_analysis()```
* Unnecessary use of temporary ```ext``` in ```analysis_filename()```
* Use blank lines between if statements since the are for different reasons
* Necessary code appears present
* Almost a good statement structure

## Test Cases
* Good set of test cases

## Literal Values used in Testing
* Mostly realistic values used based on the problem description. Why use "given_url" and "option_url"?

## Error Messages
* Proper error messages
* Messages written to proper output

## Commits
* All commit versions build successfully
* Some good, TDD commits. However, commit 7fee25 inserts a bunch of new code that would pass many test cases. One test case -> simplest implementation
* Multiple commits insert two test cases. Why?
* Good commit messages
